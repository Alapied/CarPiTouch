# CarPiTouch
If you wanted to have one of those fancy touchscreens in your car but instead of paying money for some companies piece of shit software you could use an open-source solution? Well i present my project as a solution to that problem. 

## The Key Idea
This is project to use a raspberry pi as a head unit within your car, with an intuitive GUI with Navit based maps, and Reversing/Dash camera functionality, also using mikebrady's shairport-sync to allow audio to be played as well. The goal is to eventually get to a state where this is working as a full blown hardware device, so that instructions can be easily followed


## The issues
It was a really pain in the ass to install all the dependancies for Opencv Python (cv2) and try and get the multiple cameras working simutaniously, a bunch of firmware and bandwidth issues are present in the basic working product which refused to work.
I haven't documented things well, this could use someone who knows what they're doing.
